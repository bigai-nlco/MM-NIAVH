## Introduction

To address existing limitations in long-form video language understanding benchmarks, our work takes inspiration from the latest developments in the field and develops a new benchmark specifically designed for the task of identifying specific content within extensive video material, a challenge we refer to as the Multimodal Needle In A Video Haystack (NIAVH). **This benchmark is unique due to its flexibility in supporting various modalities such as text, images, and videos as needles. It accommodates video content of any length, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of a model's video understanding capabilities**.

In our benchmark, we utilize ego-centric videos from the Ego4D dataset as the "haystack". Within this haystack, we seek to locate the "needle", which we provide in three distinct modalities. For the textual modality, we supply a crafted description. For the image modality, we employ DALL-E to create an image that visually represents this description. For the video modality, we use Sora to generate a short video clip based on the same description. In each case, the "needle" - whether text, image, or video - is set to a duration of 1 second


## Getting Started

Currently support models: 

- [VideoLLaMB-Mem](https://github.com/bigai-nlco/VideoLLaMB)
- [LongVA](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVA)
- [LLaVA-NeXT-Video-DPO](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT/blob/inference/docs/LLaVA-NeXT-Video.md)
- [PLLaVA](https://github.com/magic-research/PLLaVA)
- [MA-LMM](https://github.com/boheumd/MA-LMM)

*For additional models, please refer to the baselines we have provided for setup.*

## Evaluation Results

Given the limitations of current methods in understanding long videos, we designed an experiment where the "haystack" is a 320-second video. The "needle" is a 1-second video clip generated by Sora, prompted by the description, "the young man seated on a cloud in the sky is reading a book". The associated question posed for the experiment is, "What is the young man seated on a cloud in the sky doing?". We divided the context into 40 intervals and set the video depth at 12 intervals.
